- Add more comments!
- Add in error checking and possibly throw exceptions when parsing hits a snag or invalid JSON syn
- Think about expectations. Do you expect calling 'prettyPrint(data)' will print the data or return a string?
- Get rid of JSON::Object and JSON::Array with initializer_lists
- Solve the problem where JSON::Data data = { {"Test", 5} }; is interpreter as an object and not as an array with a string and an int
- Change int and unsigned int to accept the max values int64_t / uint64_t ? perhaps
- Test JSON With all min and max values for numericals
- Check there's enough array tests
- Check for pass by const ref and pass by value where needed
- Think about aux functions like Data::add() Data::remove()
